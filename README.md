This is my first project of The Odin Project, called Recipes.
It is a HTML project showcasing three recipes (Scrambled eggs, omelette and french toast).
All of the recipes have been linked with anchor tags in the index.html page.
The recipe pages have an image of the dish, a description with paragraphs using <img> and <p> tags respectively.
The ingredients are listed using <ul> and <li>, while the steps are listed using <ol> and <li> tags.
All the changes made during the project were committed to Git.
